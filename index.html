                        <p>
                            Every great story starts with curiosity. Mine began with a simple realization:
                            technology isn't just about writing code. It's about solving real problems for real people.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As a self-taught developer starting in 2008, I learned not just languages and frameworks,
                            but how to listen. How to understand what a client really needed versus what they asked for.
                            How a well-designed website could transform a small business, or how the right user experience
                            could make complex tasks feel simple.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This foundation of empathy and problem-solving would prove more valuable than any specific
                            technology I learned. It taught me that the best solutions come from understanding the human
                            side of every technical challenge.

                    <div class="story__text">
                        <p>
                            Writing good code was just the beginning. The real challenge was learning to see the
                            bigger picture. How individual components fit together, how technical decisions ripple
                            through organizations, how architecture shapes not just what's possible, but what's practical.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Working with teams at companies like Volusion and NetSpend, I began to understand that
                            the most important skill wasn't mastering the latest framework. It was the ability to
                            translate between worlds. Technical complexity and business value, individual contributions
                            and team success, current capabilities and future vision.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This period taught me that great technology decisions aren't just technically sound. They're
                            strategically aligned, practically implementable, and sustainable for the people who have
                            to live with them every day.

                            True leadership in technology isn't about having the best ideas. It's about creating
                            environments where the best ideas can emerge, be refined, and be implemented successfully.
                        </p>

                            Leading an 8-person team at Keller Williams, architecting systems that serve the world's
                            largest real estate CRM, launching FloCollege.com after nine years. These weren't just
                            technical challenges. They were human challenges that required technical solutions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The thread that connects all these experiences is simple: technology serves people,
                            whether that's helping real estate agents manage their business, enabling sports fans
                            to follow their passion, or mentoring developers to grow in their careers.

                            Today, I focus on building next-generation platforms and developing the next generation
                            of engineers because the best technology decisions are the ones that enable others to
                            do their best work.

                        Throughout this journey, one principle has remained constant:
                        <strong>technology is a tool for solving real problems</strong>.
                        Whether building systems that scale to millions of users or mentoring
                        a developer through their first technical decision, success comes from
                        understanding not just how something works, but why it matters.
